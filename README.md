Asp.Net 5 Beta 6 - Feature Folders using IViewLocationExpander

A simple implementation of Feature Folders for Asp.Net MVC inspired by this blog post: http://timgthomas.com/2013/10/feature-folders-in-asp-net-mvc/

This is the original Asp.Net 5 Beta 6 MVC 6 project just restructured and with a modified RazorViewEngine using IViewLocationExpander.
